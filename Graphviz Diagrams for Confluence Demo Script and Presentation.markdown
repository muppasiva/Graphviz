- **Automatic Diagram Layout**: No need for manual positioning—Graphviz handles the layout for you.
- **Support for Various Diagram Types**: From flowcharts to organizational charts, and even UML diagrams through PlantUML integration.
- **Integration with Confluence Data**: You can generate graphs directly from Confluence tables, page hierarchies, and more.
- **External Data Source Integration**: Connect to repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to pull data for your diagrams.
- **Available for Both Server and Cloud**: Whether you’re using Confluence Server or Cloud, this app works seamlessly. *(Note: If you’re on Server, support ended in February 2024, so consider migrating to Data Center or Cloud.)*\
  In short, it’s a tool that brings powerful diagramming capabilities directly into your Confluence workspace."

### Slide 3: Why Use It?

*(Display the slide highlighting the benefits.)*

"Now, let’s talk about why you should use Graphviz Diagrams for Confluence. There are several compelling reasons:

- **Simplifies Diagram Creation**: You don’t need to be a design expert. With DOT language, anyone can create professional diagrams quickly.
- **Enhances Understanding**: Visual diagrams make complex information easier to grasp, improving clarity in your documentation.
- **Improves Documentation Quality**: By integrating diagrams directly into Confluence, your pages become more informative and engaging.
- **Facilitates Collaboration**: Clear visuals help teams communicate better, making it easier to share and understand key information.\
  This app is especially valuable for teams that need to document processes, visualize data relationships, or collaborate on technical projects."

### Slide 4: Top Use Cases

*(Show the slide with the top use cases.)*

"Let’s look at some of the top use cases for Graphviz Diagrams for Confluence:

1. **Creating Flowcharts and Organizational Charts**: Document business processes, workflows, or team hierarchies with ease. For example, you can create a support workflow or an org chart in minutes.
2. **Generating Graphs from Confluence Data**: Visualize tables or page hierarchies directly in Confluence. For instance, turn a table of employees and managers into an organizational chart.
3. **Integrating with External Data Sources**: Connect to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to pull data and create diagrams. This is perfect for visualizing code dependencies or project structures in software development.
4. **Customizable Diagrams**: Choose from formats like PNG or SVG and apply different styles to suit your needs.
5. **Supporting Software Development**: Create diagrams for software components, workflows, or UML diagrams to enhance technical documentation.\
   These use cases show how versatile the app is, catering to both business and technical teams."

### Slide 5: Demo Highlights

*(Demonstrate the app with examples.)*

"Now, let’s see some quick demos to bring these use cases to life.\
**First, creating a flowchart**: Let’s say we want to document a simple support workflow. I can write a DOT code like this:

```
digraph {
    Open -> Implemented -> Resolved
}
```

And just like that, the app generates a flowchart showing the process.

**Second, generating a graph from a Confluence table**: Suppose we have a table listing employees and their managers. Using the Graph from Table macro, we can turn that table into an organizational chart. This makes it easy to visualize reporting structures or other data relationships.

**Third, integrating with an external data source**: If we have a GitHub repository with a Graphviz file, we can use the app to pull that file and display the diagram directly in Confluence. This is great for teams that need to visualize code dependencies or project structures without leaving Confluence.

These examples show how Graphviz Diagrams for Confluence enhances your documentation with rich, interactive visuals."

### Slide 6: Conclusion

*(Recap and call to action.)*

"In conclusion, Graphviz Diagrams for Confluence is a fantastic tool that simplifies diagram creation, enhances your Confluence documentation, and supports a wide range of use cases—from business processes to software development. By using this app, you can save time, improve clarity, and foster better collaboration within your team.

I encourage you to explore Graphviz Diagrams for Confluence and see how it can benefit your organization. You can find it on the Atlassian Marketplace, and it’s available for both Confluence Server and Cloud. *(If you’re on Server, remember that support ended in February 2024, so consider migrating to Data Center or Cloud.)*

Thank you for your time, and I’m happy to answer any questions you might have."

## Detailed Features and Capabilities

Graphviz Diagrams for Confluence offers a robust set of features that make it a valuable tool for Confluence users:

- **Automatic Diagram Layout**: Users describe diagrams in DOT language, and the app automatically handles the layout, eliminating manual positioning. This is ideal for creating flowcharts, organizational charts, and other graph types.
- **Support for Various Diagram Types**: It supports directed and undirected graphs, flowcharts, and UML diagrams via PlantUML integration, catering to diverse visualization needs.
- **Integration with Confluence Data**: The app can generate graphs from Confluence tables, page hierarchies, and other content. The Graph from Table macro (Server-only) allows diagrams from native tables, SQL macros, CSV macros, Excel macros, and similar apps.
- **External Data Source Integration**: It connects to external repositories like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, enabling users to pull data for diagram generation. Profiles ensure secure access to remote data, hiding sensitive credentials.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Diagrams can be output in PNG, SVG, JPG, GIF, or PDF (Server-only), offering flexibility for presentation and sharing.
- **Server and Cloud Compatibility**: Most features are available on both platforms, though some, like PDF output, are Server-only. Cloud users must manually configure URL whitelisting.

Recent updates include security improvements, removal of deprecated parameters, and enhanced scrolling for large diagrams, ensuring the app remains reliable as of April 2025.
